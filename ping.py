"""ping.py — verify the three model slugs before any arm spends real tokens (ported from decay-pin).

Two checks, cheapest first:

  1. **Slug existence (free, no key needed).** OpenRouter's model list is public; we fetch
     it and confirm each slug in client.MODELS is a real model id. If one is wrong, we
     print the closest-looking ids so the fix in client.py is a one-liner.
  2. **One-call ping (needs OPENROUTER_API_KEY, costs a fraction of a cent).** One tiny
     completion per model, so a routing/permission problem surfaces here and not ten
     trials into an arm. Prints tokens + OpenRouter's measured cost per call (the M0 cost
     ledger's first row) and flags an empty/truncated reply — the tell that a model is
     burning its budget on hidden reasoning (see MODEL_EXTRA_BODY in client.py).

The paid half is M0 task 5: per the brief's free-before-paid rule it runs only after the
anti-rig suite and pytest are green. (The slug check is free and safe anytime.)

Run:  uv run ping.py
Exits non-zero if a slug is missing or a ping fails.
